## Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/ermuunn/filament-starter.git app-name`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd app-name`
3. Install dependencies: `composer install` `npm install && npm run build`
4. Set up your environment file: `cp .env.example .env` `php artisan key:generate`
Update the `.env` file with your database credentials. (_e.g., DB_HOST, DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD_).
5. Run database migrations: `php artisan migrate`
6. Seed the database with dummy data: `php artisan db:seed`
This will generate sample data for `Customer`, `Product`, and `Category` models using Faker.
7. Create a new user to access the admin panel: `php artisan make:filament-user`
8. Start the development server: `php artisan serve` and visit `http://localhost:8000/admin/login` to access the Filament admin panel.
   (_Note: For an improved development experience, consider using Laravel Herd._)
9. Log in with the user you created in step 7 to access the admin panel.

Congratulations! üéâ You are now ready to start building your application with Filament.

## Additional Notes
### API Endpoints:
You can customize these routes and add more API endpoints as needed. The controller methods are already set up in the `App\Http\Controllers\Api` directory.
  - To access the JSON API for each model, use the following routes:
    - `/api/customer`
    - `/api/product`
    - `/api/category`

### Faker-Generated Data:
The database seeders use Faker to generate realistic dummy data for your models. This makes it easy to test the application with pre-filled data without manually adding entries. You can modify the factories and seeders in the `database/factories` and `database/seeders` directories to suit your needs.
  - **Customer Data**: Randomized customer names, emails, and phone numbers.
  - **Product Data**: Sample product names, prices, and stock information.
  - **Category Data**: Randomized category names.
